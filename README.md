## Sebastian, Software Developer in :de:

I started as a hobby programmer with a heavy focus on C++ in ~2009 because I liked the feeling of translating thoughts into tangible pieces of code.</br>
Nowadays, I prefer C# due to the ease with which one can add existing functionality to their project. Notwithstanding, low level languages such as C(++) convey valuable insights into system architecture, memory, performance, and such.
</br>

I strive to be the best at what I do. Anything else leads to boredom and that is painful.

### Be humble.
For if you are not, you are blind to improvement. There is presently a disdainful concentration of pride circulating in people's vocabularies in all the wrong combinations. Many consider themselves infallible and in their superiority, reject the idea that there is anything to be learned from less experienced contemporaries. In this instance, I envy the cooperation among Latin Americans (which is not to say that I understand them or think they are generally superior). You should (almost) never be proud of yourself; instead, you should empower those around you and make them surprise *themselves* by what they are capable of.
