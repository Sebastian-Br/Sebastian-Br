## Sebastian, Software Developer in :de:

I started as a hobby programmer with a heavy focus on C++ in ~2009 because I liked the feeling of translating thoughts into tangible pieces of code.</br>
Nowadays, I prefer C# due to the ease with which one can add existing functionality (i.e. NuGet packages) to their project. Notwithstanding, low level languages such as C(++) convey valuable insights into system architecture, memory, performance, and such.
</br>

I strive to be the best at what I do. Anything else leads to boredom and that is painful.

### Be humble.
For if you are not, you are blind to improvement. There is presently a disdainful concentration of pride circulating in people's vocabularies in all the wrong combinations. Many consider themselves infallible and in their superiority, ignore ,,,TBC,,,. I envy the cooperation that Latin-Americans are capable of. You should (almost) never be proud of yourself.

### Loving circles since 2012 :airplane:
