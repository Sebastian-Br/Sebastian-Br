## Sebastian, Software Developer in :de:

Hi there!
</br>
I'm a professional Software Engineer with relevant, enterprise-scale industry experience. </br>
While some of the projects I've published here were purely for my own enjoyment, others include publicly recognized contributions towards cybersecurity, or the world's fastest AI vision model for chess.
</br>
I started as a hobby programmer with a heavy focus on C++ in ~2009 because I liked the feeling of translating thoughts into tangible pieces of code.</br>
Nowadays, I prefer C# due to the ease with which one can add existing functionality to their project. Notwithstanding, low level languages such as C(++) convey valuable insights into system architecture, memory, performance, and such.
